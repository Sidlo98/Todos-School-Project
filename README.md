Instructions
In this assignment, you will create a todo application using Jsonplaceholder, HTML, CSS and JS. You can use css libraries such as bootstrap if you want, to be able to get a good styling on the page faster. Jsonplaceholder is a free fake online REST API where we can retrieve finished todos from a database and also simulate and write to the same databases.

Address to jsonplaceholder: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos

 

To pass approved, do the following:
Use Fetch when the page loads to retrieve todos from the API to a list that will then display on the page.
 

Create a form with a text entry and a button where the user can add a new todo. This input must be validated so that it is not possible to add an empty todo. When the new todon is added, use Fetch to make an entry to the API and then use your answer to add todon at the top of the list.
 

A text must also be printed that tells the user what went wrong if no text has been entered.
 

To pass well approved, you must do the following:
In addition to what is included in the approved, you must also make it possible to clearly mark a todo and clearly show that it is complete by changing the styling on it. It should also be possible to change back to "unclear" if it is the case that you may have printed incorrectly. Keep in mind that some todos are ready already when you Fetch them from the API.
 

If a todo is clearly marked, it should be possible to remove it from the list, but it should not work if it is not ready.
 

You should also limit the retrieval of the number of todos when the page is loaded to 10 pieces.
